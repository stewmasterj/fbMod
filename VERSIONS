	just one framebuffer object.
	All geometry and drawing routines write directly to the framebuffer
	 object.

fbMod2.f90	August 2019
	Has a framebuffer object, but also a generic pixel buffer object type.
	All drawing routines are methods of the pixel buffer (pixbuff) object.
	This is useful, to automatically draw things to a temporary buffer
	 that is not the screens framebuffer. I.e. useful for editing images.
